# table listing the pointing offsets estimated by checking the maximum of the
# solar flux with callisto.
# The table includes the following entries:
#   - datetime: date and time measured in UT
#   - phi_sky & delta_sky [deg.]: azimut and elevation angles with the sky reference system
#   - aziref & eleref [deg.]: azimut and elevation angles with the rotor reference system
#   - sigma_azi & sigma_ele [deg.]: one sigma tolerance for aziref and eleref
#   - freq [MHz]: at which the pointing offsets have been estimated
