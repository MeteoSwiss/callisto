# Atmospheric noise temperature [K] values for the Tcold measures
# These values have been taken from here
#         https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/propagation/Ka_Band/JPL-D32584_1.pdf
# The Tcold value depends on the atmospheric condisions, such as clouds, atmospheric
# gasses, rain, and so on. Therefore, here we use these tabulated values to apply a first
# order correction (rather than the fixed value at 12 K).
#
# The value of the Tcold temperature depends on the frequency, elevation and the weather
# conditions, therefore in the table we include the following columns
#     - freq:  frequency in GHz
#     - elev:  elevation in degrees
#     - cond:  weather conditions, if 'clear' or 'cloudy'
#     - AH:    absolute humidity in g/m3
#     - CL:    columnar liquid in kg/m2
#     - Tcold: estimate of the Tcold temperature in K
