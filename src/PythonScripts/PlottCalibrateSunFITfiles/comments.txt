Serveral files produce wrong flux due to:
a) interference during cold sky such as:
  - man made source like StarLink satellite
  - other man made sources, usually satellite
These files must be deleted after watching there corresponding light curves
In this case following files need to be deleted:
07:45, 09:45. 10:00, 10:45, 11:00, 11:15, 11:30, 12:00, 12:15, 12:45 and 13:30
This changes every day, it is a dynamic situation

Goal: Flux rms < 20 sfu
