This script allows to find best gain for Callisto in terms of maximum sensitivity (lowest noise figure) and
best immunity against strong local rfi such as satellites etc.
Perform sweep twice, firstly for hot load while pointing the telescope to the ground and secondly for cold while pointing to cold sky.
Avoid any geostationary satellte or Starlink.
These two files then feed into the plotting script.
Then chose best gain and edit callisto.cfg (PWM-value).
