Put inclination sensor to the dish adapter to measure elevation
Bring the dish into average elevation, such as 45째 which in most cases corresponds to rotor-elevation 0째 -> ele0

Start with azimuth at rotor-position -75 which is usually in the west, depending on mechanical mounting
Measure elevation at every 5째 or at least every 10째 till 75 in the east

Edit file non-planarity.txt as shown in the example with comma as delimiter
Do not add CR/LF at the end of the list

Run the script EstimationElevationGradient.py

When done, edit file configsun.ini and configmoon.ini with the planecorr found.
Ideally, when the telescope is perfectly aligned, it is close to 0.000
