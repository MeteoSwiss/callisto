OVS or spectral overview allows to find best frequency range in the spectrum for observation.
it also allow to identify interence signals, e.g. from satellites.
Take care to enter the correct local oscillator frequency LO of the LNB, ideally 10.41 GHz
Be aware to make two observations:
a) cold sky (Tcold) and Sun (Tsun) or
b) cold sky (Tcold) and horizon (Thot)

Based on such OVS analysis a new improved frequency file frq?????.cfg can be generated avoiding strong interferer.
